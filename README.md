Carter API - Connect your Carter agent to your Discord bot!

This program is an extract from my own personal smart-home AI system, which uses both Carter and Sanware NLP to function.

This program allows you to connect your Discord bot to your Carter agent, enabling cross-platform communication.

You will need your Discord bot token and your Carter agent token to then insert into the bot.py file, you'll also need nextcord installed.

MIT License, feel free to do whatever you want with this. It's a simple program, but Carter is created by Huw Prosser, who did the real proper work in this! Go check it out! https://www.carterlabs.ai/

If there are any issues, please do feel free to tell me. I did program this while intensely drunk.

Developed and created by Cipher at Sanware.
